The use of pesticides for crops varies depending on the type of crop, the specific pest problem, and 
the agricultural practices followed. Pesticides are chemicals or biological agents used to control pests 
that can damage crops, including insects, diseases, weeds, and other harmful organisms.

Different crops may require different types of pesticides, and the choice of pesticide is usually based on 
the target pest and the specific needs of the crop. Some common pesticides used in agriculture include:

    Insecticides: These are used to control insect pests that can damage crops. They come in various forms, 
    such as contact insecticides, systemic insecticides, and stomach poisons.

    Fungicides: These are used to control fungal diseases that can affect crops, such as rust, mildew, and blight.

    Herbicides: These are used to control weeds that compete with crops for resources such as nutrients, water, and sunlight.

    Rodenticides: These are used to control rodent pests that can damage crops and stored agricultural products.

    Nematicides: These are used to control nematode pests that can cause damage to plant roots.

    Bactericides: These are used to control bacterial diseases that can affect crops.

It is important to note that while pesticides can be effective in managing pests, they need to be used judiciously 
and following proper safety guidelines to minimize any potential risks to human health, the environment, and non-target organisms. 
Integrated Pest Management (IPM) practices, which combine various pest control methods in a sustainable and environmentally 
friendly manner, are often recommended to reduce reliance on pesticides and promote long-term crop health.
